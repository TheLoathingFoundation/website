This document is intended as a place to codify the current thinking.

Please note that anything in `{{}}` is a concept that warrants further decision.

## Mission Statement

`{{ The Loathing Foundation}}` provides affordable access to old Items of the Month for players who want to be able to use them while playing the game.

## Basic Mechanisms

**Step 1.** We buy 5 of each new IotM, funded by donations from `{{ external sources }}`.

**Step 2.** An IotM becomes available in the library for trade-in after `{{ certain conditions are met }}`.

**Step 3.** On `{{ some cadence }}`, a `{{ certain number }}` of `{{ qualifying players }}` will be given access to trade `{{ something }}` in exchange for one available item in the library.

**Step 4.** Each month additional IotMs are purchased using `{{ some portion }}` of the `{{ something }}` that was traded in step 3.

## Some Specifics

There has been a lot of discussion about how those blanks might be filled in, as well as some words of wisdom from players more sage.  This tries to capture those ideas.

### Who donates? ("`external sources`")

> **Step 1.** We buy 5 of each new IotM, funded by donations from `{{ external sources }}`.

This project would be funded by ASS members and well intended meat farmers who are interested in chipping in a collective 50 Uncle Bucks per month (5 Mr. As / month) for the good of the community.  This list would need to be fluid (nobody can be expected to always contribute; having this be relatively robust would be key.)

### How do items mature? ("`certain conditions are met`")

> **Step 2.** An IotM becomes available in the library for trade-in after `{{ certain conditions are met }}`.

The logic behind having conditions for when an IotM is available is that in the months after an item is available in Mr. Store it is still generally affordable.

This could be any combination of:

* After the item hits a certain meat value (e.g. over `2x` the price of a Mr. A)
* After a certain amount of time has passed (e.g. after `1 year` has passed from initial release)
* Something Else (e.g. ???)

### What is the distribution cadence? ("`some cadence`" / "`certain number`")

> **Step 3.** On `{{ some cadence }}`, a `{{ certain number }}` of ...

Should access be granted on some kind of a regular basis?  This can obviously shift as we need it to.  Some possible approaches...

* X times a month, randomly.
* X times a month, on a regular period.
* Continuously through the month until X % of the library has been distributed.
* Something else.

### Who can borrow? ("`qualifying players`")
> **Step 3.** ... `{{ qualifying players }}` will be given access

Who gets to access this?  The rule of thumb down to the mission statement.  The goal of this system is not to make the rich richer, it's to provide a way for players who cannot otherwise afford an item to buy it at an affordable price, and use it for personal use.  For instance:

* if someone has a net worth of a trillion meat, anything is affordable.
* if someone owns the item then they already have it.
* if someone only wants the item in order to sell it later then they don't want it to play with.

This could mean qualifications that look like this:

1. No multi accounts.
2. A player cannot trade for an item that they already own.
3. A player must use the item they trade for pretty much right away.
4. Maybe a player can't have more than { ??? } some meaningfully high net worth in their mall or display case.

It seems fair to say that the player should be somewhat established / established enough to know that they will actually value the darn item.  This could mean:

5. A player must have an account over 9 months
6. A player must have 3 ascensions
7. A player must have `Bawdy Refrain` hardcore permed
8. A player must complete a hilarious quest of some kind!  (e.g. going and perming Bawdy Refrain)

There might be a form, or process or even something as general as a `sniff test` from a group of trusted people.  This is (important) logistical detail and very much TBD.

### What is traded in? ("`something`")
> **Step 3.** ... to trade `{{ something }}` in exchange for one available item in the library.

The initial idea is that a player would trade a `Mr. Accessory` (e.g. $10 of meat).
It was later brought up that it might be reasonable to have it be `Mr. A + 1 Uncle Buck` (so $11 of meat) which would mean trade activity would expand the pool of IOTMs.

The 11 idea seems pretty reasonable, still affordable, and also lore appropriate.

### How does reinvestment work? ("`some portion`")

> **Step 4.** Each month additional IotMs are purchased using `{{ some portion }}` of the `{{ something }}` that was traded in step 3.

We want re-investment to be smooth so that in a given 12 month period we have comparable numbers of the historic IOTMs (minus those that were traded of course).

A reasonable formula could be `ceil(X / 12)` -- which means if there were 13 Mr. A's in the trade-in pool then there would be 5 + ceil(13 / 12) = 7 of the current IotM bought.

## Some Considerations

1. People will try to abuse this system.
2. We want to be fair and open and trustworthy, but we don't want to change the behavior of who buys IOTMs when they come out -- this shouldn't be seen as a cheaper source of an IotM than Mr. Store.
3. We want to think about how this could influence speculation behavior.  I don't think this would benefit speculators but it's worth a few cycles of thinking.
