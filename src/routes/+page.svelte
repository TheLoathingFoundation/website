<div id="mission">
	The Loathing Foundation provides <em>affordable access</em> to items sold in <a href="https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Mr._Store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mr. Store</a> for players who want to <em>actually use them</em>.
</div>

<h2>Wait, What?</h2>

<p>The Loathing Foundation is a philanthropic community project from the <a href="https://discord.gg/kol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ascension Speed Society</a>. We provide a way for players to potentially access <a href="https://museum.loathers.net/player/3580284" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">past items of the month</a> without having to spend billions of real world dollars.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>Each month we invite some number of members to purchase one of the items that our loathing economists have deemed "available for distribution".</p>
<p>Selected players will be able to trade <em>1 Mr. A + 3 Uncle Bucks for one "available" item of their choice</em>.</p>
<p>The player gets the item, and The Loathing Foundation gets currency to buy future Items of the Month to add to the pool of future items!</p>

<h2>Is this some kind of scam?</h2>

<p>No!</p>

<h2>What's the catch?</h2>

<p>If you obtain an item through The Loathing Foundation <em>you must use it</em>.</p>
<p><em><b>Do not sell it</b></em>.</p>
<p>We can't force you to do the right thing, but if we learn that you're taking advantage of this crazy idea to flip items and make a personal profit then you will have made us all very sad (and your membership to the foundation would be revoked, leaving you ineligible to make future trades).</p>

<h2>How do I participate?</h2>

<h2>How did you get all this stuff, some kind of infinite meat bug?</h2>

<p>All items in The Loathing Foundation have been generously donated by members of the community (or purchased using the funds gained from the trade-in process).</p>

<h2>Can I donate?</h2>

<p>Absolutely! Send any donations via kmail to <b>TheLoathingFoundation (#3580284)</b></p>
<p>Please note: <em>We do NOT deal with meat, only Mr. Accessories, Uncle Bucks, and items that you can buy from Mr. Store.</em></p>
